# State-Augmeted-Information-Routing
The repository contains the source code for policy routing in packet based networks. We leverage the use of unsupervised learning methods to improve the efficiency of packet based routing which is superior to conventional non-learning methods. We use Graph Neural Network parameterization for the routing optimization which provide the classical properties of stability and transferability.
